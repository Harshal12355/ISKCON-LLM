(1.1)!@#$%"Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kurukṣetra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship - even for the denizens of heaven - Dhṛtarāṣṭra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of Pāṇḍu favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous."^&*()What is Duryodhana's purpose in speaking to Dronacarya?!@#$%Duryodhana pointed out that Drona trained Dristadyumna, even though he was destined to kill Drona.... Drona did this because Dristadyumna was in the right caste and he thought he deserved to learn..."Duryodhana pointed out this mistake of Droṇācārya's so that he might be alert and uncompromising in the fighting.

-While there was no fear in the Pandava's hearts when the Kaurava's blew their conch shells, "the hearts of the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra were shattered by the sounds vibrated by the Pāṇḍavas' party. This is due to the Pāṇḍavas and their confidence in Lord Kṛṣṇa. One who takes shelter of the Supreme Lord has nothing to fear, even in the midst of the greatest calamity."^&*()State various signs pointing to the Pandava's victory.

(1.21)!@#$%"Although Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless mercy He was engaged in the service of His friend.

(1.24)!@#$%"Guḍākā means sleep, and one who conquers sleep is called guḍākeśa. Sleep also means ignorance.

Duty: "But as a ksatriya, he requires a kingdom for his subsistence, because the ksatriyas cannot engage themselves in any other occupation. But Arjuna has no kingdom" so he must fight

"This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a kṣatriya. Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be cowardly." Ex. Rama didn't fight when He was refused the throne but He did fight when Sita was kidnapped

"Good population in human society is the basic principle for peace, prosperity and spiritual progress in life...On the failure of such varṇāśrama-dharma, naturally the women become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of unwanted population.

But on the death of the elder members, such family traditions of purification may stop, and the remaining younger family members may develop irreligious habits and thereby lose their chance for spiritual salvation."



Good population is based on the "faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to be misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both children and women require protection by the elder members of the family"^&*()1.Explain the significance of addressing Krishna as "Madhusudana".

(2.3)!@#$%"Arjuna was addressed as the son of Pṛthā, who was the sister of Kṛṣṇa's father Vasudeva. Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with Kṛṣṇa...Kṛṣṇa did not want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a kṣatriya (by giving up fighting)"^&*()What are Arjuna's arguments in this section for not fighting?

If He were not spiritual, there would be no importance to His words and the Bhagavad Gita would not be important. Krsna also says that in the future, He and everyone would keep their individuality- Refutes that loss of an independent identity after death

Jivas are eternally existing as fragments of the Supreme and have the tendency to fall into material nature- Counters Mayavadi theory of the oneness of the spirit soul^&*()Explain the "theory of reflection". (2.13)!@#$%"The theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul, who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the Paramātmā.
