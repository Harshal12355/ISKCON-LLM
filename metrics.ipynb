      "Wherever there is Lord Krishna, the master of yoga, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality. This is my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "The purpose of life, according to the Bhagavad Gita, is to establish a loving relationship with Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When we engage in devotional service to Krishna, following His instructions as given in the Gita, we can achieve true success and fulfillment in life. Just like Arjuna followed Krishna's guidance on the battlefield of Kurukshetra and attained victory, we too can achieve success in our lives by surrendering to Krishna and following His teachings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical Guidance:\n",
      "To apply this teaching in our daily lives, we should strive to develop a personal relationship with Krishna through the practice of bhakti-yoga. This includes chanting the Hare Krishna mantra, reading the Bhagavad Gita regularly, and engaging in devotional activities that please the Lord. By dedicating our thoughts, words, and actions to Krishna, we can experience His presence in our lives and receive His blessings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Encouragement:\n",
      "Remember that Krishna is always with us, guiding and protecting us at every step. By surrendering to Him and following His instructions with faith and determination, we can attain true success and happiness in life. Keep striving to deepen your relationship with Krishna and continue on your spiritual journey with enthusiasm and devotion. Krishna will surely bless you with His mercy and grace. Hare Krishna!\n"

      "In simpler terms, the purpose of life is to develop intelligence and purify it so that we can understand God (Krishna) and our relationship with Him. This is achieved by engaging in the practice of Bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, which helps us cultivate love for God through various spiritual practices such as chanting the Hare Krishna mantra, reading scriptures, serving others selflessly, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "One common misconception is that material accomplishments or personal happiness are the purpose of life. However, Bhagavad-gita clearly teaches (2.45) that even the most exalted material achievements are transient and temporary: \"na te viduh sarva eva, mam anantim tame matayo, yan matisye na labhyate, prana-samyogaya ca.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To apply these teachings in our daily lives, we should try to develop detachment towards materialistic pursuits and focus on strengthening our relationship with Krishna. This does not mean neglecting our duties or responsibilities; rather, it involves performing them as offerings to God while keeping our minds focused on Him.\n",
      "\n",
      "To further deepen your understanding of the Bhagavad Gita's teachings, I would recommend studying Chapter 18, which is dedicated entirely to the glories and qualities of Krishna. Additionally, you may find Srila Prabhupada's books \"Bhagavad-gita As It Is\" and \"Srimad Bhagavatam\" to be invaluable resources for spiritual growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, life is a journey towards understanding God and our relationship with Him; it is a process of growth, learning, and evolution. With faith and determination, you will find the path to Krishna consciousness. Hare Krishna!\n"
